# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview

In this project we are looking at a data set of Kickstarter Campaigns and the variables associated with those campaigns.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to discover the relation of outcome to the lauch dates and funding goals of different Kickstarter campaigns.  This is to help determine if our clients campaign was comparable to the others with regards to these two variables.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We first performed an anaylsis on the relationship between the outcome of a campaign and the launch date for campaigns in the Theater subcategory.  This will show if there is a relationship between what time of year the campaign is lauched and the success rate.  This would be adventagious we determining when to lauch future campaigns.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We next performed an anaylsis on the relationship between the outcome of a campaign and the goal funding amount.  This will show if there is a coorelation between success of a campaign based on the amount of the goal.  We created categories for the Goal amounts to group the data into ranges.  This was do by grouping campaigns with a goal less than $1,000 and then groups at $5,000 incriments up to $50,000.  We found the percentage of each outcome for each of the goal categories.  By understanding the relationship between the success rate and the goal amount future campaigns can tailor their goals to be more successfull.
