# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview

In this project we are looking at a data set of Kickstarter Campaigns and the variables associated with those campaigns.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to discover the relation of outcome to the launch dates and funding goals of different Kickstarter campaigns.  This is to help determine if our client's campaign was comparable to the others with regards to these two variables.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I first performed an analysis on the relationship between the outcome of a campaign and the launch date for campaigns in the Theater subcategory.  This will show if there is a relationship between what time of year the campaign is launched and the success rate.  This would be advantageous in determining when to launch future campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I next performed an analysis on the relationship between the outcome of a campaign and the goal funding amount.  This will show if there is a correlation between success of a campaign based on the amount of the goal.  I created categories for the Goal amounts to group the data into ranges.  This was done by grouping campaigns with a goal less than $1,000 and then groups at $5,000 increments up to $50,000.  I found the percentage of each outcome for each of the goal categories.  By understanding the relationship between the success rate and the goal amount future campaigns can tailor their goals to be more successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties
With regards to the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis, if the criteria used to create categories is not evenly distributed of the groups contain too little or too much of the dataset then the resulting analysis could be misleading.  

## Results
As can be viewed on the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date graph above there is a spike in the number of successful campaigns launched in the summer months.  The rest of the year failed and successful campaigns show the same trends.  We can conclude that the number of successful campaigns increases in the summer as well as the overall number of campaigns increases in the summer months.

As can be viewed on the Outcomes Based on Goal graph above successful campaigns are a higher percentage for the smaller goal amounts less than $5,000.  The percentage of successful campaigns shows a gradual decrease to $25,000.  Above the $25,000 goal the percentage of both failed and successful campaigns varies greatly. 
### Limitations
The dataset is not large enough to have a proper sample of all the categories, subcategories, dates and locations to properly analysis.  Since the data has only been collected from one crowd funding source this limits the view of the overall sector.

### Future Analysis
The relationship between the percent of the goal is pledged and the outcome could be explored.  If the pledged amount greatly exceeds or falls well short of the goal then the goals of future campaigns could be adjusted based on this analysis.
